^26^ The praises recited   
by the Chief Lector Priest  
while sanctifying the Lord  
with all that come forth   
on his Potter's Wheel.  
   
All mortals shall see  
the excellent things done by the Ka,[^fn-322-1]  
and the good things he made for them,  
from the desire that his name endure  
upon earth for his Ka:  
he who acts as potter for eternity.  
   
Pacifying Khnum the Good Protector  
with his utterances.  
Words spoken:  
   
Greeting to you,  
Sobek[^fn-322-2] who came forth from Atum,  
Khnum [^fn-322-3]

[^fn-322-1]: ![](./images/322_26_1.png){width=9%} - @sauneron-1, p. 123, and @sauneron-5, p. 238, translated this term as "le dieu", without further comment.
[^fn-322-2]: This brief passage would seem to support the suggestion that Khnum of North Esna was worshipped in crocodile form.
[^fn-322-3]: The hymn ends abruptly, with no indication of whether it continues elsewhere at Esna.
