^15^ Akhet IV day 1 (= [Khoiak 1](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-i-55.html#khoiak-1)),  
Festival of Amun, great Nun,[^fn-346-1]  
father of the gods;  
Festival of the Hand of God,  
(divine) mother of all the gods;  
Festival of Khnum;  
Festival of casting the book of Hapi,  
assembling the great offering for Hapi,  
of bread, beer,  
cattle, fowl,  
wine, milk,   
myrrh, incense, honey,   
fruits, fresh plants,   
and all good and pure things.  

</div>

[^fn-346-1]: ![](./images/346_15_1.png){width=7%} - @sauneron-5, p. 54, translated this group as "Tan(en)", without further comment. Indeed that god's name is spelled with an initial obelisk in [Esna 388], 8, but that writing at least contains the expected determinative for Tatenen. Accordingly, I prefer reading the signs as ideograms for Amun and Nun, with the possibility these particular hieroglyphs would have evoked the name of Tatenen for ancient Egyptian readers just as for Sauneron.

</div> 

[^fn-346-2b]: This phrase apparently refers to [Khoiak 1-6](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-i-55.html#khoiak-1-6), when many divinities visited Esna, and multiple rituals were performed.

[^fn-346-3]: Although this ideogram could also read "Nebtu", the context suggests reading it otherwise. Hathor of Agny, north of Esna, had her own festival a couple of days earlier on Hathor 29, detailed in [Esna 344]. In that hymn, Hathor of Agny is identified with Nebtu, and the main calendar for [Hathor 29](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-i-55.html#hathor-29) describes similar events, including the visit to the Great Place, as a "Festival of Nebtu." As such, the present events mentioned here either refer to the days leading up to Khoiak 1, or similar rituals were performed for Nebtu in North Esna (Per-Khnum, Per-Netjer) during Khoiak, as suggested in [Esna 344], 14.

[^fn-346-4]: The same ritual disrobing by women before Hathor-Nebtu, echoing the famous episode of this goddess in the Tale of Horus and Seth, is mentioned again in [Esna 344], 11.

[^fn-346-5]: ![](./images/346_21.png){width=35%} - @sauneron-5, p. 62, translated this group as: "purifier la grande manifestation de Knêph et d'Ouadjyt, maîtresse du Per-Out, qui repose ici." While this pairing of serpentine deities would be interesting, this overlooks a direct parallel in [Esna 74](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/north-anta-71-76.html#esna-74), 25-26. This is simply the incipit of a canonical hymn to incense attested in many temples and on ritual papyri.

Her [...] roams the fields with them,[^fn-346-7]  
Isis on the right,  
Nephthys on the left.  
Eye of Re,  
who illumines the two lands,  
who makes Egypt shine,  
who makes Esna(?) beautiful,  
so Egypt received all happiness.  
  
The gods and goddesses of the districts,  
their hearts are pleased,  
to see Khnum in his *wpy*-festival.  
The Majesty of this god is justified  
in all of his trials (*wp*),  
in his good festival  
of making judgments.[^fn-346-8]    
   
He establishes his son, Horus,   
to appear in glory upon his throne,    
as a beneficent king, for all time.

[^fn-346-7]: The restoration here is unclear. This could simply be "her child", an allusion to Heka who also visits the Great Place around this time. Yet the subsequent mention of Isis and Nephthys suggests this might somehow refer to Osiris.

[^fn-346-8]: Another allusion to the neighboring divinities visiting during Khoiak 1-6. Similar descriptions occur in *Esna* II, 81, 5-6; 127, 8-9; [Esna 337], B. See recently @recklinghausen-fremden, pp. 541-546.

Stopping at the front [courtyard?].  
^23^ Utterances spoken:  
'Welcome, welcome in peace!  
*Nbỉ.t*-cow,  
who unites with the god (Khnum),   
Nebtu-Menhyt the great,  
has come to Per-Khnum.  
How pleasant is the *nbỉ.t*-cow when she comes,  
and indeed now she has come!'  
  
As she goes around the field,  
her fragrance is in all the plants,  
and her divine scent  
comes forth within Per-netjer:  
thus she fills the temple with her goodness.  
  
Her brother (Khnum) gives his hand to hers,  
he performs the *wrh*-dance for her (see [Esna 380]),   
and he elevates her Majesty,  
when she comes into Mound of the Chicks,  
it is her city of dancing;  
she rests there with him,  
and they are delighted together.

'Greetings!  
Khnum-Shu,  
great, eldest son of Re,  
who unites with his sister, Tefnut,[^fn-346-9]   
in her name of Menhyt-Nebtu.  
The faces of the brother and sister align  
in their good festival  
of IV Akhet day 1 (= Khoiak 1).  
  
Per-netjer is made august,   
Temple of the Bas celebrates continually,  
the Good Field  
is overwhelmed with wpy-festival;  
and all four corners of your domain  
are in happiness.  
  
Your Ka is great in peace,    
the mound is made sacred   
through your oracular decree,  
and your heart rej[oices].  
  
Nebtu-Menhyt the great,   
she comes to you as the august one,   
in her visible form of a *nbỉ.t*-cow.

[^fn-346-9]: Most of the following text has direct parallels in [Esna 351], as well as *Esna* II, 81, 6.

[^fn-346-10]: This curious phrase occurs several other times, and seems to allude to Khnum receiving justification on Khoiak 1 and 2. See [Esna 337], B; [Esna 351], A.
