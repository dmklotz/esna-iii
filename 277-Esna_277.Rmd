</div>

[^fn-277-1]: Similar terminology refers specifically to Khnum the Good Protector in [Esna 196], 10-11. There, in his form of Shu of Per-Khnum of the Field, he takes care of Atum, Osiris, and other Heliopolitan dead through his sweet breath.

</div>

[^fn-277-3]: ![](./images/277_22_5.png){width=15%} - Reading suggested by @ruter, p. 66. Alternatively, since this verse refers to Khnum as imperious sun during the day, one might alternatively suggest reading *ʿḥʿy*, "he of the mid-day," an epithet of Re that occurs in [Esna 331], 13: ![](./images/331_13_2.png){width=14%}.

</div>

[^fn-277-4]: Despite the apparent spelling of *ʿȝ*, and the alternative suggestion by @sauneron-5, p. 167, n. j, this reading of this horizontal sign as *sḫm* is based on the parallel epithets in [Esna 375], A; [Esna 392], 20.

great of form;  
Ptah, who birthed the artisans.  
There is no work on earth  
of which his Ka is ignorant.

</div>

[^fn-277-6]: Following the interpretation by @sauneron-5, p. 169 (*contra* @ruter, p. 68, n. 320), this seems to be a phrase designating humans, perhaps in contrast to the common phrase at Esna: *gȝ.w-ḥty.t*, "those with closed throats (= fetuses in the womb)." For more examples of this phrase, see [Esna 250], 21; [Esna 259], 3 (5); [Esna 371], 19; and possibly *Esna* II, 17, 39; [Esna 387], 5. See similarly @pichel, p. 65, n. a.
