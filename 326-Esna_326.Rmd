the day of striking[^fn-326-1] [...]  
[...] of the Guardian Deities,  
good protector of Great of Justification,  
guardian (*gs-****dp***) of those upon earth (***tp****y.w-tȝ*).  
  
She who comes with the bow,  
champion[^fn-326-2] who keeps safe the All-Lord  
from the rebels,  
while protect gods and people:  
Lady of Combat.[^fn-326-3]   

</div>

[^fn-326-1]: The same phrase with more context in [Esna 324], 15.
[^fn-326-2]: ![](./images/326_A_1.png){width=6%}![](./images/326_A_2.png){width=9%} - Notable spelling of mwnf, "guardian; champion", but compare [Esna 324], 9, where Neith is also "champion of the All-Lord."
[^fn-326-3]: Similar epithet in [Esna 328], B.

Khnum the Good Protector

</div>

[^fn-326-4]: ![](./images/326_B_1.png){width=15%} - Notable spelling with the two crocodiles.
[^fn-326-5]: ![](./images/326_B_2.png){width=30%} - *LGG* I, 481b, and IV, 259b, read the first section as "great protector of the river (*nh wr ỉtrw*), and the second as "he who does the rowing (*ỉr ẖn.t*)." Despite the unusual spelling, this is almost certainly a popular sequence of epithets for Khnum the Good Protector, as preserved in the nearby [Esna 325], 8: ![](./images/325_8.png){width=32%}. The first few signs appear to be mistakes, perhaps based on spellings such as those found in *Esna* VI, 479, 8-9, 15; 482, 8-9.
