^1^ Have fear for Khnum,  
those who travel in any place!  
   
He is the effective guardian,    
of whomever walks on his water.  
The lord of astral influence,

He is the lord of prestige,  
great of miracles,

</div>   

[^fn-355-27]: @sauneron-5, p. 173, n. nn, translated "les châteaux-de-princes", with the nuance "un château féodale," assuming it had something to do with important officials who could place people in prison. This interpretation was followed by @ruter, p. 73, n. 346. Both interpretations overlook the juridical institution known as the *ḥw.t-wr.w 6*, "House of the 6 Great Ones." A Late Period biography links official duties in that office, with shackled prisoners: @guermeur-bastet, pp. 180-181, col. 2, 184, n. p. The people addressed in this verse are not high officials, as above in verses 17-19. Rather, the hymn now speaks to people in need of protectors, whether legal aid or physical distress (verse 28).

When they call out to him,

[^fn-355_30]: The lion in Khnum's name alludes to the epithet *mnhz*, as well as multiple allusions to the lion-shaped bed.

Foremost of the Divine Tent.

[^fn-355_31]: The beard and feather allude to attributes worn by the properly mummfieid and justified dead, just like Osiris.

He is the living Ba

That he arrived as the Inundation  
^6^ (that he arrived as the Inundation)  
is to flood the field,  
and to inundate the land

[^fn-355-32]: Note this spelling of Khnum features two *rsy*-hieroglyphs.

He is the Ba of Shu,  
foremost of Iunyt.[^fn-355-33b]  
He arrives as a pleasant wind    
to enliven all that exist,   
to make the field grow,    
and to produce all seeds,  
^7^ (to produce all seeds)   
for those whom he created.[^fn-355-33c]  

</div>   

[^fn-355-33]: Note this spelling of Khnum featuring the *mḥ*-hieroglyph.
[^fn-355-33b]: The hymn distinguishes between Khnum of Elephantine in the preceding verse (§32), and Khnum-Shu from northern Heliopolis, alluded to via the alternative name of Esna, Iunyt. 
[^fn-355-33c]: Other texts allude to this ancient Egyptian conception: Khnum from Elephantine releases the flood waters from the south, while Khnum-Shu as the north-wind blows from the Mediterranean, temporarily blocking the Inundation waters in the Delta for the growing season: @sauneron-agricole.
