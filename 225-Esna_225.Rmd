[^fn-225-68]: For this epithet, see @gabolde-1995, especially pp. 244-245, n. 38. The similar passages from Esna all use the verb *swr*, "to make great", rather than *sḫỉ*, "to elevate; make rise."

[^fn-225-69]: ![](./images/225_69.png){width=18%} - The same term occurs in a similar context in *Esna* II, 12, 14: ![](./images/12_14.png){width=10%}. Both terms have been left untranslated: *LGG* III, 476b; @recklinghausen-derchain, p. 26, with n. 73, whereas @sauneron-8, p. 19, apparently skipped over this term in the present hymn. In both texts, this designates a form of Khnum who regulates the flood waters, and in *Esna* II, 12, 14, he is also ram-headed, "tall of double plumes, and possessor of a beard." The determinative suggests this might be a mummy or ram-headed statue. Meanwhile, the first sign, typically an ideogram for *mḏd*, elsewhere writes the term *mỉt.t*, "likeness": *Esna* VII, 629, 1; 633 (p. 228, line 8). Accordingly, this might refer to a specific statue or other replica (*Wb*. II, 39, 12) of Khnum near Elephantine.

[^fn-225-88]: @sauneron-8, p. 21, translated *ʿn*, "to be pleasant", as "la compassion" without comment. Although not noted there, this nuance relies on a similar passage in *Esna* VII, 619, 26-27 (partially preserved also in [Esna 396], 13), where the verb *ȝms*, "to be compassionate" occurs instead.
