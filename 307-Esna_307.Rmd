^21^ Words spoken by the King of Upper and Lower Egypt,  
Osiris,[^fn-307-1]  
Lord of the Two Lands,  
^22^ (Wennefer justified)|  
Sovereign of the gods,  
mighty ruler,  
who emerged from the womb  
crowned with the White Crown,  
Lord of the Double Crown,  
nsw-king of the gods,  
bity-king of humans,  
Great Ruler in the entire earth,  
Mighty in all lands,  
Ruler through victory and strength.

[^fn-307-1]: ![](./images/307_21.png){width=20%} - Reading *Wsr*, "Osiris": *w < wȝḏ.ty*, "the two uraei" + *s < sḫm.ty*, "the double, pschent crown" + *r < rḥ.ty*, "the two companions (Isis and Nephthys)." All of these acrophonic values occur in the longer Osiris litany, and each consonant evokes the dual kingship of Upper and Lower Egypt.

I have the white crown of Re,

Shu has united them for me

^23^ Unto you is the white crown,  
as nsw-king of Upper Egypt;  
and the red crown,  
as bity-king of Lower Egypt,  
they are united as the double crown,  
and you appear as king with it  
as King of Upper and Lower Egypt.  
   
All foreign lands are bent over  
because of your power;  
the Nine Bows are united  
beneath your sandals;  
your enemies have fallen  
beneath you;  
Egypt is pacified and loyal to you:  
Ruler of eternity,  
whose (like) shall never be repeated.
