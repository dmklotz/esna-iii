^A^ The King of Upper and Lower Egypt,  
Kematef,[^fn-375-0]  
magnificent of strength,  
great of rage,[^fn-375-1]  
whose moment of fury is fiercer  
than Sakhmet in her strength.  
  
Attacking Ba-ram,  
who tears up the marshes.[^fn-375-2]  
Lord of air,[^fn-375-3]  
life and death are under his control:  
Khnum, lord of power and might.

[^fn-375-0]: ![](./images/375_A1.png){width=10%} - A similar spelling occurs in *Esna* VI, 507, where it designates the primeval serpent Neith. It is unclear precisely how the ram functions in these spellings. Possibly it just serves as a determinative, since the phonetic elements of Kneph/Kmeph are adequately supplied by the other signs (i.e. *qmȝ=f < km-ȝ(.t)=f*).
[^fn-375-1]: The following epithets are paralleled in a nearby hymn to Khnum from column 18: [Esna 392], 20-21.
[^fn-375-2]:  ![](./images/375_A2.png){width=18%} - The reading of the second sign is uncertain. *LGG* III, 196c proposed reading: "Der jedes überschwemmte Land zerteilt (*fdq šȝ nb*)", but the parallel from [Esna 392], 21 indicates *nb* belongs to the following epithet. Moreover, it seems unlikely the multiple aggressive and violent epithets would be followed by a reference to Khnum apportioning lands. Rather, the verb *fdq* often refers to mauling enemies, or tearing up plants and roots from their farms: P*WL*, p. 391.
[^fn-375-3]: ![](./images/375_A3.png){width=25%} - The second sign must be restored after the parallel in [Esna 392], 21: ![](./images/392_21a.png){width=8%}![](./images/392_21b.png){width=23%}

^B^ The King of Upper and Lower Egypt,  
Menhyt, who illumines the two lands,  
beautiful of face,  
who loves dancing,  
Lady of *wrh*-dancing,  
for whom rejoicing was invented;

</div>

[^fn-375-5]: Most of these epithets allude to the scenes of Trajan, as Shu, dancing for Menhyt-Nebtu-Tefnut, as recorded on this column ([Esna 380], [Esna 382], [Esna 384], C, D), and elsewhere in the pronaos: *Esna* VI, 520. Cf. @nebtu-dance.
