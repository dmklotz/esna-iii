the prophets are purified

Announce the god, sancitfy the path,

Procession of this august god,   
Khnum-Re Lord of Esna,

Carrying the potter's wheel before him    
by the Great Governor;[^fn-284-0]      
travel among the guardian deities,[^fn-284-1]    
union with the sundisk,     
by this great god.    
    
Meanwhile everybody performs their role.  
How great is it to behold in the streets!  
But without revealing any hidden parts.  
  
How great is the sanctity of his Majesty   
while on the sacred road,   
until he unites with his temple  
^3^ among his follower.  
  
This god comes to a stop  
underneath the kiosk;  
do not enter his temple   
until the 9th hour  
of III Peret 1 (= [Phamenoth 1](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-ii-77.html#phamenoth-1)).  
</div>

[^fn-284-0]: As @sauneron-5, p. 127, n. 2, noted, a similar ritual is depicted elsewhere in *Esna* VI, 543: ![](./images/543.png){width=35%}
[^fn-284-1]: These are the protective divinities on standards who clear the path during processions, as depicted in [Esna 52](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/north-anta-71-76.html?q=pr-wr#above-the-gods-on-the-standards), 17 and [Esna 74](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/north-anta-71-76.html?q=pr-wr#above-the-gods-on-the-standards), 33.

Set up his potter's wheel  
in each of his four corners,  
of all place where he might be.   
  
Be very careful,    
lest it slip away from him,    
because he created -  
populating the earth - by means of it.  
^4^ Avoid it very greatly!  
  
For he is this god,   
who populates the earth through his work,   
this Ptah,[^fn-284-2]    
who creates the artisans   
within the Blocked Cavern (of Memphis).

</div>

[^fn-284-2]: During this festival of "Lifting up Heaven", Khnum is first associated with Ptah (artisan who uses the potter's wheel), and then Shu-Heh who hold up the sky (identified here with the kiosk's roof). The separation of heaven from earth by Heh (sportively alluded to in the spelling of Ptah's name) is the preliminary step of creation, and the cosmic potter's wheel supporting the sky then produces all living beings. For this complex network of religious concepts, see primarily @berlandini-1995.

His Ka then rests    
beneath the aforementioned kiosk,

in the First Moment.   
It is Shu who is under it (the sky)   
for the limits of eternity,    
in his manifestation of Heh.  
  
^5^ His Ba arrives from the sky,   
upon his terrestrial image,    
his Majesty alights upon his statue,    
from the desire to populate this earth.

He is on his throne,  
building humans,   
and making all things.   
  
His heart rejoices  
to see goodness;    
his hands are firm    
fashioning the egg upon his wheel,   
every day.  
  
As he modeled humans,   
^6^ so he birthed gods.  
  
He distinguished the king in the womb,   
guiding him,    
in order to confer the world to him,      
to the limit of cyclical eternity.    
He is called   
by his name of Son of Re,   
(Domitian Augustus)|,  
his beloved.

[^fn-284-3]: Throughout this text, a phrase that looks like *m-ʿ* occurs multiple times. Sauneron translated the examples as "in the hands of; along with", but this does not seem to make sense in every attestation. I assume this is a variant of *m-dỉ* for *m-ḏr*, "when; then." It might also be *mỉ*, a variant of the imperative *ỉmy*, "let; cause!"
