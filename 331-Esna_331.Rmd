^7^ Praising this goddess  
in great sanctity.  
Words spoken:  
  
The sky is festive,  
the earth is turquoise,  
the temples are strewn with faience.  
  
The gods make *hy*-jubilation,  
the goddess(es) make *hnw*-praise,  
and the sunfolk worship before her.  
  
Neith, the very great,[^fn-331-1]  
who made what exists,  
surrounding her city with happiness.  
  
She shines from her palace,  
with all *ʿnḫ-ḏd-wȝs*,  
Great Nut  
^8^ having repelled storm clouds,  
and cleared away rain   
from its area,  
so that the sky lights up,  
and the earth shines.    
  
Great nether-sky (*Nn.t*),[^fn-331-2]  
is supported in her recumbent form.  
She directs a festival a second time  
on the first day   
of the Festival of Lifting up Heaven.

</div>

[^fn-331-1]: ![](./images/331_7_1.png){width=8%} - The reading of this divine name is uncertain. The present hymn celebrates Neith as the sky (Nut), mother of Re, specifically during the festival of Lifting up Heaven. As such, the sky hieroglyph is used in many different ways throughout the text. In later verses, Neith is also called ![](./images/331_8_1.png){width=12%} (331, 8), and ![](./images/331_17_1.png){width=12%} (331, 17). Since the sky sign writes the uniliteral value *n* in multiple words here (e.g. *wbn*, "to rise", "Tatenen"), the present translation assumes the name with the single sky sign is "Neith", the one with two sky signs is *Nn.t*, "nether-sky," while the three sky signs write *šps.t*, "august one." But other interpretations are possible for the present instance, such as *štȝ.t*, "mysterious sky" (elsewhere associated with Neith and creation, e.g. [Esna 216], 5, 22), "Nut", or even simply *p.t*, "sky" (see below, column 11).

^9^ Tatenen appears,  
a second time.  
One calls her majesty 'linear eternity'.[^fn-331-3]  
She is Tatenen:  
2/3 of her is male,  
1/3 of her is female.[^fn-331-4]  
She who creates rays,  
who repels darkness,  
who clothes the sundisk  
in her radiance,  
and who hides him   
^10^ within her iris.[^fn-331-5]   
   
As she rises, her bright rays illumine,  
allowing one to perceive their fellow;  
she also appears as the moon,  
having driven away darkness.  
  
She is Nut, of Akhty (Re),[^fn-331-6]  
he rises and sets in her;  
she is infinite,  
^11^ and her limits are unknown.[^fn-331-7]  
  
She who rises as the sun,  
and appears as the moon,  
having illumined the shores  
with her perfection.  
   
As she made what is,  
so she created what exists,  
begetting all living things.  

</div>  

[^fn-331-3]: The same name is given to Neith as infinite sky goddess in [Esna 317], 2-3; see also [Esna 216], 3 (11). There might be a phonetic pun her between "Tatenen" and *ḏ.t*-eternity.
[^fn-331-4]: For the meaning of this epithet, see @klotz-caesar, pp. 173-174. The same concept is alluded to in the Neith's litany, [Esna 216], 2, 6-9, where she is "Irita who made Tatenen, Tatenen who made Irita, man ho acts as a woman, woman who acts as a man."
[^fn-331-5]: These epithets borrow phraseology from cloth-offering scenes, wherein the solar goddess clothes and conceals Re within her luminous appearances. See @klotz-ram, pp. 178-180.
[^fn-331-6]: For this passage, see @klotz-baboons, p. 34.
[^fn-331-7]: Most of the preceding epithets occur in  the architrave *Esna* IV, 421, 2-4, roughly above the present column.

Her Majesty is called 'Sky'.  
As she began the two lands  
^12^ through her plans,  
so she made all things,  
as the creation of her heart.    
  
She sails across the sky  
as her heart dictates.  
Her son, Re, rejoices  
before her.  
His arms are in praise  
to the Lady of gods,  
creating praises,  
for his mother, the Mighty.  
  
She [births?] him as a ^13^ child  
in the morning:  
Re himself jabbers for her Ka.  
  
Her young one, the Ba at Noon,[^fn-331-8]  
(that means Harakhty),  
worships her perfection.  
  
As she is strong, so is Atum strong,  
kissing the earth before her.  
  
</div>

[^fn-331-8]: ![](./images/331_13_1.png){width=28%} - @sauneron-5, p. 156, n. v, tentatively rendered this phrase quite differently: "jeune homme qui a dépassé une certaine durée de temps (*rnp zbỉ ʿḥʿw*)". As he recognized, this part of the hymn refers to the three stages of the sun: youth in the morning, young man at noon (= Harakhty), and Atum at night. Hence one expects a reference to the term *ʿḥʿy*, "mid-day; noon." Alternatively, this could be a corrupted version of bA-HD, "bright Ba", another epithet of Khnum as a solar ram: [Esna 276], 16, 17: ![](./images/276_16_17.png){width=20%}.

Let us make dancing

Let us bow to the ground

Let us sanctify the ground

When she comes from the Akhet of the sky,  
her scent ^18^ is of Punt,  
her aroma is of myrrh:  
Rayet, who shines when she appears,  
her adornments are greater  
than any adornments in Egypt.  
   
The sky, which is scarce of great rains,[^fn-331-9]  
no goddess equals her!  
Who is [the goddess]  
[who would even resemble] her form?   
 
</div>

[^fn-331-9]: Difficult passage, with a different explanation by @sauneron-5, p. 157, n. ii. The present translation assumes this is another reference to Neith-Nut as a sky clear of clouds (see *supra*, cols. 10 and 14). The combination of the verb *ʿnḏ*, "to be lacking; scarce", and *ḥw.t p.t*, "rain", recalls the famous Tell Defenna stela. Where Egyptian troops are stranded in a desert area, since "rain fall is scarce (and pw Hw.t) in the southern regions. The goddess Neith of Sais saves the day by creating an unusually high Inundation: @cavasin, p. 8, line x+13.
