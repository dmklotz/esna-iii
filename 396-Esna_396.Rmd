[^fn-396-1]: This scene belongs to the Festival of Seizing the *ʿwn.t*-staff, celebrated on Epiphi 19-20: see [Esna 196] and following texts.

[^fn-396-1b]: Note the spellings: ![](./images/396_1.png){width=7%}. The feather writing *ʿ*, "arm", is attested elsewhere: @kurth-1, p. 269. For the first sign, Kurth did not register the phonetic value *m-ʿ*, "from" < *mỉ*, but see already @sauneron-4, p. 9, n. b; and add [Esna 249], 6 (27) and [Esna 366], 5 (19).

[^fn-396-2]: ![](./images/396_3.png){width=11%} - See *Wb*. IV, 157, 12-17. The plant sign is a mistake for the expected brazier determinative.
