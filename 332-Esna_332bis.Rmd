^27^ You are Lord of the Field,  
Ruler of the agricultural district:  
the very sunlight is your district!  
Khnum,  
nobody else apportions fields.  
  
You are the Lord of gods and people,  
who made what exists,  
Ptah-Shu who became King of the Two Lands  
in his Per-Wer shrine in Ankh-Tawy (Memphis);  
Sovereign who appears on the throne of eternity;  
Lord of Maat,  
Overseer of his city ^28^, forever.[^fn-332b-1]

[^fn-332b-1]: ![](./images/332_bis_27_1.png){width=20%} - @sauneron-5, p. 227, translated without further comment: "le dieu siegneur de son temple", and *LGG* III, 559a, only translated: "der Herr in ...?..." Rather, the first two signs appear to write *nb-mȝʿ.t*, a very common epithet of Ptah (*LGG* III, 639c), and the recumbent lion writes *ỉmỉ-rȝ*, "overseer", a common Late Period abbreviation; cf. *Wb* II, 94, 5; @klotz-philae, p. 92, n. m; and also *Esna* IV, 431, 4.

You are Irita,  
who makes Sed Festivals;[^fn-332b-2]  
every god came after him,  
succeeding his throne in Kha-Nefer;[^fn-332b-3]  
nobody enters the palace without his knowledge.  
  
Son of Re,  
excellent heir of Atum,  
to whom he granted his office,  
after he made for him an inheritance document[^fn-332b-4]   
in his name.

[^fn-332b-2]: ![](./images/332_bis_28_0.png){width=30%} - This is apparently a dittography: the first group a standard spelling of the phrase, the latter more concise using the elaborate wedjat-eye for *ỉr* and the ideogram for *ḥb-sd*. Irita, as a form of Memphite Ptah, was naturally in charge of Sed Festivals. 
[^fn-332b-3]: As @sauneron-5, p. 229, n. t, noted, this is an alternative name for Memphis, similar to Mennefer or Kha'nefer (*ḫʿỉ-nfr*). Khnum is linked to this toponym elsewhere in *Esna* II, 16, 1. 
[^fn-332b-4]: ![](./images/332_bis_28_2.png){width=12%} - Note the unusual spelling of *ỉmỉ.t-pr*, "inheritance document." The standing man apparently writes *ỉ < ỉȝw*, "old man", just as in the writing of Atum immediately above: ![](./images/332_bis_28_1.png){width=10%}; for the latter, compare *Esna* II, 127, 9; 190; [Esna 214], A.
