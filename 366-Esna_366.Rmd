Cry unto him,   
this god bearing the sky:  
he will open his daughter Nut for you,  
with the rain (lit. sweat) you desire.

Have fear for Khnum,    
men and women  
who desire to bind their seed.  
  
He is the procreating ^2^ bull,  
who mounts the females:  
an empty womb is never assembled  
through his work.

He is Shu, foremost of the Mammisi,

This (god) Hu,  
lord of statements,

Have fear for Khnum,   
all fields  
along with all their plants!  
The cistern and the field,[^fn-366-24]   
the white crown supports the red crown  
for his Ka.[^fn-366-24a]  
  
For it is his breath  
which makes your petals blossom.  
  
(Look to the northern column [Esna 355])
  
</div>   

[^fn-366-24]: This seems to be an allusion to other texts that refer to Khnum-Shu (= the cistern (*ẖnm.t*)) uniting with the field in North Esna: *Esna* II, 127, 4; [Esna 348], 27-28.

[^fn-366-24a]: Perhaps the crowns are mentioned in this particular verse because they were originally made from plants? For a different explanation, see @sauneron-5, p. 172, n. jj.

He is the effective guardian...
