he [...] it   
as Nut[^fn-313-1];  
his father Amun, decress for him  
kingship[^fn-313-2] in domestic and foreign lands.  
  
As he fashioned people, gods,  
small and large livestock,  
birds, fish, and serpents,  
so did he create all that exists  
in this earth;  
distinguishing Shai and Renenet,  
while the four birth-bricks  
attend upon the Lord of the Potter's Wheel.[^fn-313-3]
  
</div>

[^fn-313-1]: ![](./images/313_A_1.png){width=18%} - @leitz-loeffler, p. 99, parsed this section differently: *m njwt Jmn*, "in der Stadt des Amun", but that does not explain the suffix pronoun. While that interpetation of the goddess ideogram is possible, one might instead see a connection to the 4 birth-bricks mentioned in the related offering scene, since one of them is identified directly with Nut: [Esna 311], 13.
[^fn-313-2]: ![](./images/313_A_2.png){width=6%} - @leitz-loeffler, p. 103, n. ff, read this sign as *sḫm* (< *sḫm.ty*, "Pschent crown"), citing also [Esna 300], 6. Both examples also make sense as the verb *nsw*, "to rule as king."
[^fn-313-3]: ![](./images/313_A_3a.png){width=7%}![](./images/313_A_3b.png){width=34%} - @leitz-loeffler, p. 99, read this section slightly differently. The most remarkable feature is the phonetic spelling of *fd.t*, "four" as *f-t-tȝ*. The entire phrase finds an interesting parallel in the related scene [Esna 311], 11 and 14 (not mentioned by @leitz-loeffler, p. 99): ![](./images/311_12_1a.png){width=22%} **(...)** ![](./images/311_12_1b.png){width=22%}. The four birth-bricks act on behalf of the "Lord of the Potter's Wheel (*nb nḥp*)" again in [Esna 311], 18 (translated differently by @leitz-loeffler, p. 99).

[^fn-313-4]: This first, damaged epithet apparently refers to Nephthys, represented in [Esna 312], and who is said to take care of Osiris in Aba in [Esna 278], 9.
[^fn-313-5]: The same pun on the name Anukis (*ʿnq.t*) and "pleasant of body" (*ʿn qd*) occurs in the related scene [Esna 312], 6.
[^fn-313-6]: This seems to be an allusion to the visit by Nephthy of Komir to Esna during the festival of Khoiak: [Khoiak 1-6](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-i-55.html#khoiak-1-6), as mentioned in the calendar *Esna* II, 55, 5.
