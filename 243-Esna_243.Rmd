[^fn-243-2]: A nearly identical series of epithets for the following occurs in *Esna* VI, 537, 16-19.

[^fn-243-3]: ![](./images/243_9.png){width=15%} - The parallel in *Esna* VI, 537, 16, substitutes "Per-netjer" here, which would fit the general context (offering agricultural products), and the subsequent mention of Kematef and Lord of the Field. However, to read this toponym here, the *Hw.t*-sign would need to stand for *pr*, which is not impossible, but  
Other examples of this toponym appear rather to be Hw.t-it, "Temple of the Father", the primary designation of Esna proper as a temple of Khnum-Re: *Esna* II, 56; or possibly just *ḥw.t-nṯr*, "temple." 

[^fn-243-4]: ![](./images/243_10a.png){width=8%}![](./images/243_10b.png){width=2.3%} - Another problematic toponym. The parallel in *Esna* VI, 537, 18, clearly writes "Iunyt", but that might be another reinterpretation. In another set of parallels, the two rams on a standard substitute for "Esna": [Esna 339], 3 = [Esna 241], 7, §49. In that instance, we probably have the two rams writing *sn.t* (< *snw*, "two"), the original form of the toponym Esna without initial *tȝ*. The same applies to other examples of this spelling. However, in the present text, the banal epithet "Lord of Esna", already mentioned earlier, would seem unlikely to appear as a secondary designation of the god. Rather, the specific form "Lord of Iunyt" seems more fitting.
