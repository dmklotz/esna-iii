^4^ Akhet III day 2 (= [Hathor 22](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-i-55.html#hathor-22)),  
Beginning of the Festival  
of Heka the Child  
within Iunyt,   
that means: Lord of the Palace.  
'Going to the field  
by Heka the Child'  
[so it is also called].  
  
Now when the first hour  
of this day arrives  
the sky-watching priest calls out  
in this temple.  
  
Each priest purifies himself  
in the pure lake of the temple;  
arrive in purity,  
presenting a great, composed offering   
(of) all good things:  
of ^5^ bread, cattle, fowl,  
wine, brewed beer, fruits,  
fortified wine, honey, fresh plants,  
without limit.

by the Scribe of the God's Book.  
  
Procession of The Child,  
enter to the field,   
and coming to the limits.   
Recite the *sȝḫ.w*-hymns  
of 'Going to the Field':  
recitation to be spoken:  
  
Come, o child,  
son of Nebtu,  
very great, first-born of Khnum,  
(to) the good field of Khent-ta!  
Wander among the vegation,[^fn-340-1]  
So the plants scintillate     
like[^fn-340-2] lapis-lazuli;  
and remove (all) blight,[^fn-340-3]  
(you who are) numerous of garlands,    
just like the moon(?).[^fn-340-4]  

</div> 


[^fn-340-1]: ![](./images/340_5_1.png){width=16%} - Note that *swtwt*, "to wander; roam", is spelled here as if it were *swȝḏwȝḏ*, "make verdant." The same, rare verb describes Heka in the fields in [Esna 341], 8.

[^fn-340-2]: Here and throughout this text, two circles appear to write *mỉ*, "like" < *mȝȝ*, "to see." 

[^fn-340-3]: Note a similar sequence of epithets in [Esna 239], A, with parallels noted there. For *qnw*, "blight", see P*WL*, p. 1060.

[^fn-340-4]: ![](./images/340_5_2.png){width=10%} - @sauneron-5, p. 32 did not translate this portion, and did not even transcribe all of the signs. Understanding here the moon sign writing *wȝḥ*, "garland" < *wḥʿ*.

Calves bearing milk offerings(?),

Enter into the field.  
Behold it.  
  
Then the Majesty of this god goes  
to the pronaos of the Great Place;  
a *wʿb*-priest with access to Per-netjer   
arrives in great purity,  
a censer and vase in his hands,  
also a cup of milk(?),  
and all good things   
are carried behind him.  
  
Purify (in) view of this god,  
offer incense,   
offer cool water   
^6^ upon the great altars   
all around (the place).  
  
The Chief Lector Priest  
reads out recitations  
with a loud voice;  
the chanters rejoice,  
and the woodwinds play music.

Opening the Doors of the Great Place.  
Words spoken:  
  
'The Child opens   
the Doors of the Great Place,    
just like the sky is opened for Re...'  
(Look to the papyrus for the rest).  
   
The Majesty of this god goes forth   
to the forecourt    
of the August Ape (Atum),[^fn-340-5]   
along with the Children of Re.  

</div>

[^fn-340-5]: ![](./images/340_6_1.png){width=28%} - @sauneron-5, p. 33, translated this group as "(le) beau protecteur sacro-saint (= Khnoum)", apparently understanding *p(ȝ) nḫy nfr šps*. Yet while that form of Khnum also visits the divine necropolis, the correct reading can be found by comparing the litany to Heka, [Esna 242], 20 (32): ![](./images/242_20_32.png){width=26%}. That ape is mentioned in connection with the double-doors of the Great Place, and most likely the Children of Re (text partially restored). As elsewhere, the ape most likely is a form of Atum, revered alongside his children in the Great Place. Note that on the north exterior wall (*Esna* VII, 613) the king offers the simian *wnšb*-symbol to the Children of Re alongside Re-Horakhty.

The son of Sakhmet (Heka) has entered   
to this place(?).'  
  
Proceed to the Palace,  
elevate offerings,  
perform incense,

perform the (offering?) of a milk-calf(?)[^fn-340-7]  
for the Ka of the gods and goddesses,  
the Children of Re;

The majesty of thie god rests;

</div>

[^fn-340-7]: ![](./images/340_6_2.png){width=14%} - The reading is unclear to me. A similar phrase seems to occur above in column 5. This would be a variant of the phrase *bḥz* ***r*** *ỉrṯ.t*, for which see *Wb.* I, 469, 5-7. Presumably a young calf would be sacrificed in honor of Heka the Child. @sauneron-5, p. 33 translated "faire l'offrande de lait", but did not comment on what the word for "offering" is here.

Heka the Child:[^fn-340-10]

[^fn-340-10]: ![](./images/340_8_1.png){width=8%} - Reading uncertain. @sauneron-5, p. 34, translated "qui n'as pas ton égal", apparently recognizing the phrase *nn ḥr-ḫw=k*.
