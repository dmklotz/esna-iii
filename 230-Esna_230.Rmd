^A^ The King of Upper and Lower Egypt,  
who appeared from the lotus  
at the beginning of creation;  
who created the primeval ones  
in the initial moment;  
who arose from lotus bud,  
who shines from the lotus.  
  
He came into being as Re,  
in the High Mound (of Hermopolis),  
issuing commands  
to the entire world:  
Khnum-Re Lord of the Field.

^B^ The King of Upper and Lower Egypt,   
Tatenen the great,  
who came about in the beginning,  
while the great Mother was with him,  
(namely) the living serpent  
who produced all creation.  
  
She remains (*mn*) around (*ḥȝ*) him,  
in her name of Menhyt (*Mnḥy.t*),  
also called Nebtu by name.  
  
Coming forth to the front,  
the gods conduct him  
in his good festival  
of the Renenutet Festival;  
his son likewise on this day ( [Pakhons 1](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-ii-77.html#pakhons-shomu-i)):[^fn-230-1]  
Khnum-Re[^fn-230-2] Lord of Esna.

[^fn-230-1]: That is, the Divine Birth festival performed for Heka on Pakhons 1. According to the festival calendar (*Esna* II, 77), the same day also featured a procession of Khnum and his Ennead, and that seems to be what is described here.
[^fn-230-2]: ![](./images/230_B1.png){width=8%}![](./images/230_B2.png){width=5%} - *ẖ < š < šms*, *n < nw*, "to see", *m < mʿbȝ*, "30". The final word might allude back to the Renenutet Festival, which properly began on the final day of the month of Renenutet (Pharmouthi ***30***), leading up to the birth of the child god on Pakhons 1.
