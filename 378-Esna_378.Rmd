^9^ Another hymn to Khnum.  
Words spoken:  
  
You are the Lord of Esna,  
Chief of the potter's wheel,    
who models gods,  
who fashions the sunfolk,   
and literally all animals.   
  
Pleasant of face with double plumes,    
good of form, foremost of the gods,    
kind of face with ram heads,     
there is not god who resembles you.  
  
Truly beloved ram,  
who made what is and is not,[^fn-378-0]    
^10^ who birthed the gods,    
and begot the goddesses.

Hidden, his form cannot be known;  
remote, his image cannot be known.  
  
He who emerged from Nun,  
who appears with the flame (of a uraeus);  
Hapi emerges from the grottoes     
beneath his sandals;

to the nose of gods and humans.

[^fn-378-2]: ![](./images/378_12_1.png){width=25%} - @sauneron-5, p. 213, translated the participle as "qui répand sa lumière", with no comment, while *LGG* II, 321a, transcribed it as *wbn*. Although that verb would fit the context, the child sign does not elsewhere stand for the first two consonants (*w* or *b*). Rather, the existing signs are appropriate for *ḫʿỉ*, "to appear; shine", and that word is spelled elsewhere with two children: *Wb*. III, 239, 4. The present reading assumes a geminating form (*ḫ+ʿ+ʿ*), but the first child could also write *ms*, thus resulting in the related term *msḫʿ*, "radiant birth; appearance."

[^fn-378-9]: ![](./images/378_21_3.png){width=12%} - @sauneron-5, p. 216 already guessed the two kings here write *nb* through acrophony (*n < nsw*, *b < bỉty*), but he assumed it belonged to the following epithet.  
  
[^fn-378-10]: ![](./images/378_21_2.png){width=23%} - @sauneron-5, p. 216, read the first groups literally ("le maître de chaque jour, (?), de la fête mensuelle, de la fête du quinzième jour"), and assumed Khnum was simply written as an ideogram. However most spellings of Khnum in this hymn employ sportive acrophony, and that is likely the case here as well. The first consonant is clearly *ẖ < ẖr.t-hrw*, but the derviation of *nm* from the other groups remains obscure to me.  

NB: From this point on, @sauneron-5, pp. 218-219, n. t, only translated isolated groups of the extremely difficult text. As throughout this hymn and the following ([Esna 379]), many of the non-divine words are spelled using acrophonic values, sometimes determined with traditional spellings. It is easy enough to recognize the phrase *rs=k nfr* here, which suggests the following verses actually belong to [Esna 379], rather than the preceding hymn where each stanza begins with *twt*, "You are..."

</div>

[^fn-378-11]: *r < rw, s < zmȝ, k < kȝ*, an ideogram of the royal Ka.

[^fn-378-12]: The ram wearing a uraeus appears elsewhere in spellings of *wbn*, with the uniliteral values *w* < *wȝḏ*, "cobra", *b < bȝ*, "ram": @klotz-baboons, p. 34, n. b. Here the two eyes would appear to write *n < nw*, "to see" (see the spelling of *wbn* above in col. 12). Then the final ram with a flail would be a variant of the expected *nṯr*-sign as a determinative. The following two signs would present too many determinatives. Instead, one of them (likely the sundisk) writes *m < mȝwy*, "radiance", while the two uraei write *w* (< *wȝḏ.ty*) in *nbw*. Khnum on top of the basket would be the determinative for the entire epithet.     

[^fn-378-13]: A similar writing of *ỉtn* with Tatenen and Neith occurs in [Esna 387], 1. Here the winged sundisk would write *ỉ* < *ʿ* < *ʿpy*. The next term is uncertain: *ỉtn nfr* is a common epithet (*LGG* I, 617b), note especially *Esna* VI, 541, south (also spelled: *ʿtn*). However, the trap almost always writes *sḫt*, but perhaps here a variant name for a net, *nn.t/nm.t*, is intended. Thus resulting in *n < nn.t, f < fȝỉ* (see the next stanza), *r < ršw*.  

[^fn-378-14]: *LGG* II, 159c, read this alternatively as *ʿnḫ.tw m stw.t=f*, presumably understanding the first lion as *tw* < "Tutu." However, the term *mȝwy*, "radiance", is elsewhere written with the lion (e.g. *Esna* VI, 541, north), and the same epithet with *mȝwy* occurs in *Esna* II, 48, A; [Esna 268], B; see also *LGG* II, 145b-c.

[^fn-378-15]: These epithets reflect the Egyptian solar cycle, and the riddle of the Sphinx; cf. [Esna 219], 5 (different phrasing). The exact reading of each sign is uncertain. The first verse is simple: Khepri = *ḫ < ẖr, p, r < Rʿ*, Morning = *d < dp, wȝ < wỉȝ*. In the second verse, the signs appear to be in the wrong order, and I emend to: solar disk = *ỉ < Ỉmn, t < ỉty, n < nṯr* (crocodile); the mummy writes *m*, and the sundisk with uraeus writes *hrw*. Finally, in the last verse Atum (*Ỉtm*) = *ỉ < ỉʿḥ*, "moon", *t < tḫn*, "obelisk", *m < mȝʿ.t*, "Maat." Finally *mšr(w)*, "evening", could be *m < msỉ*, "to give birth", *š* (standard value of crocodile), *r < rʿ-nb*. Other readings are certainly possible.
