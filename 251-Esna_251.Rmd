^21^ Giving praise to Menhyt.

You are Rayet,  
who illumines the two lands,[^fn-251-0]    
she remains (*mn*) ^22^ and shines (*ḥȝ*)  
on the head of Re,  
in this her name of Menhyt (*Mnḥy.t*).

</div>

[^fn-251-0]: Same epithets of Menhyt in her litany: [Esna 233], 18, §20; also [Esna 371], ; 14; *Esna* VI, 489, 12.

#### §2 {-}

<div class="col2">

You are the *nt*-waters who made what is (*nty*),  
and created what exists (*wnn.t*);  
Mother of God,  
who created the gods;   
Menhyt,[^fn-251-1]    
the surging of Hapi;  
the great Mother,  
who began the binding of seeds,  
who made what is (*nty*),  
and created all things,  
in this your name of Neith (*N.t*).

</div>

[^fn-251-1]: ![](./images/251_22_2.png){width=18%} - This spelling uses the same signs as *ḥȝy*, "to flood; surge" used in the subsequent phrase. @sauneron-5, pp. 107, 108, n. c, translated: "à la fois Vent et Inondation", assuming that despite the spelling of the first term, it should actually be the homophonous *ḥȝy*, "wind." Rather, while §1 refers to Menhyt as the sun, this section is entirely about Menhyt-Neith as creator and primeval *nt*-waters, so it makes sense that she is the feminine "flooding (*ḥȝy*)" aspect of the Inundation. Compare the litany to Menhyt, [Esna 233], 17, §14: "for Menhyt, who surges as Hapi (*ḥȝy m Ḥʿpỉ*)"; also *Esna* VII, 552, 6-7.

#### §3 {-}

You are the great, august one,

great of love,  
Bastet,  
^23^ the goddess great of *wpy*-festival,  
for whom rejoicing was invented.  
  
The girl who acted as mother (*tmȝ.t*)  
for he who created \<her\>,[^fn-251-3]    
in this her name of Mut (*Mw.t*).  

</div>

[^fn-251-2]: Same sequence of epithets in [Esna 239], B.
[^fn-251-3]: Without emendation, this could also read "who acted as mother for the Creator" (so @sauneron-5, pp. 108, 109, n. f); the present restoration was inspired by similar epithets of Mut, daughter who acted as mother for her father Re: @klotz-caesar, p. 170, n. 1097.

You are the replica,

the Akhet, the throne,  
his rule, his kingship  
on heaven and earth,  
in order to make her satisfied (*ḥtp*),  
in her name of Nebet-hetepet (*Nb.t-ḥtp.t*).

You are Weret-hekau,

Lady of days and months,[^fn-251-5]  
for whom one holds annual festivals  
in order to appease her,[^fn-251-6]  
in this her name of Sakhmet.  

</div>

[^fn-251-5]: For Sakhmet presiding over all days, compare her famous retinue of statues from the Mut Temple complex, and her connection to the daily Chronokrator Genies: @yoyotte-litanie.
[^fn-251-6]: For this ritual of appeasing Sakhmet, see @goyon-shtp.

You are the mistress,

who rises and coils (*mḥn*) upon the head  
of her father, Re,  
in her name ^24^ of Mehyt (*Mḥy.t*).[^fn-251-7] 

</div>

[^fn-251-7]: For the goddess Mehyt of Abydos/Thinis, similar in many respects to Menhyt, see @cauville-mehyt. Ignore the suggestion by @sauneron-5, p. 110, n. l, to correct this to "Mehenet."

#### §7 {-}

You are the Lady of 'Agny,[^fn-251-8]  
who enters Thebes as a panther,[^fn-251-8b]  
and gives birth to the sun  
in the Mut Temple;  
Eye of Re,  
who enters Heliopolis on the 6th day,  
in this her name of Hathor.  

</div>

[^fn-251-8]: Hathor Lady of 'Agny was a major goddess from the region around Esna, and is mentioned multiple times throughout the temple.  
[^fn-251-8b]: For Menhyt as a panther, see also [Esna 233], 22, §44, and possibly *Esna* II, 127, 7.

great of plans in all places (*s.t*),  
in this her name of Isis (*Ỉs.t*).

You are the Lady of Edge of the Land   
all the way to the *pehus* (of the Delta);[^fn-251-9]  
living serpent in the sky,  
who makes a conjunction with Benu (Venus),[^fn-251-9b]    
and shoots out Hapi from the grottos,  
when ^25^ he floods (*sṯ.t*) the two lands  
at his season,  
in this her name of Sothis (*Spd.t*).

</div>  

[^fn-251-9]: ![](./images/251_24_9.png){width=28%} - @sauneron-5, pp. 108, 110, n. p, refrained from translating the first sign. Nonetheless, this epithet is paralleled in the Menhyt litany, [Esna 233], 25, §60: ![](./images/233_25_60.png){width=32%}, and again in a water offering scene for Menhyt, *Esna* VII, 552, 7: ![](./images/552_7_1.png){width=20%}. Based on the context, the first toponym does not seem to be Khent-ta, the usual cult center of Menhyt, but a homonymous designation for the southern border of Egypt (*Wb* III, 306, 6-7). For Menhyt as Sothis, see also [Esna 233], 17, §13; *Esna* II, 31, 55-56, and cf. @pichel, pp. 134-135.
[^fn-251-9b]: Agreeing with the translation of @sauneron-5, p. 108, this would appear to refer to a conjunction of Sothis and Venus, in relation to the New Year Inundation. Nonetheless, a parallel to this whole verse occurs in a water offering scene for Menhyt, where the term bnw, "Phoenix", is replaced with *tȝ*, "earth," suggesting one also understand *bnw*, "earth" here. If that is correct, the verb *sḫn* would have some different connotation here.
