from your arrows.  
  
He shall make you excellent  
against Be (Seth):  
you will strike him down!  
Apophis:  
you will annihilate him!  
^22^ May your harpoons be sharp,  
and the fire burn,  
(at) the Horizon of Eternity![^fn-207-1]  
Be on guard, team!  
(at) the Horizon of Eternity!  
in order to strike down Apophis,  
in heaven and earth,  
and in the council  
of every god and goddess.  
  
Re is justified against Apophis,  
four times:  
shoot (an arrow) to the south,  
may you be sharp (in) heaven and earth,  
and repel all the enemies  
of Re,  
in the south, likewise north,  
likewise west, likewise east.

[^fn-207-1]: @sauneron-5, p. 288, n. x, emended the Akhet into the chopping block (*ḫb.t*), and transcribed the unusual sign later as *ỉȝ.t*, "le lieu saint", in both cases understanding *nḥḥ* as an adverb ("eternally"). However, context suggests this refers to the ultimate destruction of enemies (stabbing, shooting, burning) in the Eastern Horizon, whence the present translation.

Proceed to her temple in peace.

Hey, hey!  
She has arrived in happiness.
