^1^ III Shomu 20 ( [Epiphi 20](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-ii-77.html#epiphi-20) )  
Festival of Taking the Baton,  
also called the Victory Festival of Khnum.  
  
Morning of the procession   
of the Ruler of Herdsmen;  
performing purifications   
by the Chief Lector Priest.  
Enter inside Per-netjer,  
while he is adorned in his ceremonial clothes;  
the festival papyrus in his hand,  
for this festival.   
  
Stop on the dromos  
of the Temple of Shu,  
beside the mysterious Duat which is there,  
his face toward the *zȝ-nb-ẖnn*-lake;[^fn-259-1]  
awakening the august god [^fn-259-2] within it.  
Words spoken:  
 
</div>

[^fn-259-1]: For the sacred lake of North Esna, see @sauneron-5, pp. 325-326, n. c.
[^fn-259-2]: ![](./images/259_2_1a.png){width=18%}![](./images/259_2_1b.png){width=5%} - The interpretation of this passage is complicated. The crocodile very often writes the word nTr, "god", at Esna, without any indication it is referring to a reptilian manifestation. Yet for this text, @sauneron-1, p. 103, translated the hieroglyph as "crocodile"; @leitz-rams, p. 254, built upon this interpretation and argued the crocodile was a standard manifestation of Khnum Lord of the Field, thus explaining the choice of this sign in the famous crocodile hymn, *Esna* II, 126. It is true that Khnum can be invoked in hymns as a bull, lion, or crocodile (cf. @leitz-rams, p. 254, n. 17; see also [Esna 262], 20, §§8-9). While it is tempting to assume an actual crocodile was revered inside the sacred lake of North Esna, the corresponding festival text from the calendar *Esna* II, 77, 17, only mentions that funerary offerings are performed in this location for deceased gods such as Atum.
