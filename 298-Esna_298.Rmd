**NB**: The first text is quite difficult, so it is produced here. This translation involves confusion between the similarly-shaped baskets (*nb, ḥb*) and the winged scarab (*ʿpy*, *ʿ*), attested throughout Esna.

^A^ Live the good god,  
scintillating of appearances  
in the marshes(?)[^fn-298-1] of Chemmis.  
He who was [^fn-298-2] born to be [^fn-298-3] Lord,  
so he might multiply festivals for his god,  
the Lord of Life (Khnum).

[^fn-298-1]: Reading uncertain. The determinative, context, and final phonetic signs (*ḥ* < *ḥʿw*) suggests the term *ỉdḥw*, but it is unclear how the other signs function in this word.
[^fn-298-2]: The passive *tw* seems to be written with an ithyphallic, ram-headed god. Elsewhere at Esna, similar figures of Min write *m*, or *kȝ* (< Kamutef). Perhaps the phonetic value derives from *ṯȝy*, "(virile) male"?
[^fn-298-3]: The *ḥb*-basket seems to be confused for the winged sundisk (*ʿpy*), which can write the preposition *r* < *ʿ* < *ʿpy*. The subsequent winged sundisk sign, meanwhile, writes *ḥb* via similar confusion.

[^fn-298-4]: ![](./images/298_B_1.png){width=5%} - Alternatively, this could be an unconventional phonetic spelling of *qd*, "to build," which fits the general syntax of this epithets better.
[^fn-298-5]: ![](./images/298_B_2.png){width=15%} - As noted in @leitz-loeffler, p. 104, n. jj, the first sign likely writes *mn* < *mȝn*, "to see", and second writes *ḥ < ḥḥ*, "Heh." Thus *mn+ḥ+t*, "Menhyt."
