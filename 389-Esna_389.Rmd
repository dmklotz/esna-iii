^12^ Another hymn to Khnum.  
Words spoken:  
  
^13^ Greetings,  
Khnum-Re Lord of Esna!  
Ptah-Tatenen,  
foremost of the Southern District,  
he who created the artisans  
within the Blocked Gro[tt]o,  
Father of Fathers,  
great god in the Temple of the Father.  
  
Shu, South of his Wall,  
foremost of Iunyt,  
beneficent ancestor,  
Lord of gods and people;  
who began Shai,  
^14^ lord of the birth-brick.  
  
He is the Ka, foremost of Kas,  
who begat the gods,  
who built all livestock,  
who created birds,  
who produced fish,  
and he made all snakes.

[^fn-389-1]: This section details the first generations of Khnum as a primeval creator, similar to Theban theology concerning Amun. Kematef exists first, followed by the demiurge (Ptah-Tatenen-Irita), who emerges from Nun waters and creates the dry earth with the solar rays of his eyes. The determinative to Kematef here shows Khnum as a ram-headed crocodile.
[^fn-389-2]: This "mysterious image" is likely a ram-headed crocodile like Kematef.
[^fn-389-3]: ![](./images/389_16.png){width=17%} - The spelling of Khnum alludes to the current cosmogony. He is a crocodile emerging from the initial flood waters, similar to the divine crocodile depicted in *Esna* II, 112.
