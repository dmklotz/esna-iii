Awake beautifully,   
Great Builder[^fn-249-1],  
Khnum-Re Lord of Esna!  

He who populates the earth  
with his handiwork,  
who opens the potter's wheel,  
who creates the birth-bricks,   
Shai and Renenet,   
who makes the decree:  
Khnum, who made the Khnums.  

</div>

[^fn-249-1]: ![](./images/249_1.png){width=16%} - @sauneron-5, p. 91, n. w, tentatively read this epithet as *pȝwty*, "primeval one." Yet the alternate version in [Esna 318], 11, §14, simply writes: ![](./images/318_11_14_0.png){width=20%}. @leitz-loeffler, p. 50, n. 181, assumed both versions write *pȝ nḥp wr*, arguing the present writing with the snake could represent *nḥp* < *(n)ḥf* < *ḥfȝw*, "snake." However, the ideogram of Khnum at the potter's wheel generally writes *qd*, not *nḥp*. In the following text - [Esna 350], 6 - the cobra writes *d(wȝ)*, "hymn." Perhaps here the term *qd*, was intended to have a small *q*-sign, omitted or hard to identify.

Lord of the agricultural domain!  
He who builds the egg,

as he makes air  
for every nose;  
they live in order to see him.  
He who makes a son  
in the place of his father.

Awake beautifully,  
Chief of the Potter's Wheel!  
Who fashioned the gods,   
and formed everybody  
upon his potter's wheel,   
in his name of Khnum,  
Lord of Iunyt,  
foremost of Per-ankh.   
  
He who weaves his light,   
who illumines darkness,  
whose radiance repels ^2^ obscurity,  
who guides the body with his fingers,  
in this his name  
of Khnum-Re, Lord of Esna,  
foremost of the Chapel of Upper Egypt.[^fn-249-2]

</div>


[^fn-249-2]: ![](./images/249_2_16.png){width=13%} - @sauneron-5, p. 92, n. cc, suggested the middle group was a corrupted version of a scarab, thus writing *ḫnty tȝ-šmʿ*. Yet the sign more closely resembles the classic serpent stone hieroglyph, yielding the known epithet "foremost of the Upper Egyptian shrine" (*LGG* V, 790b-c). Note that Khnum is also called *ḫnty ỉtr.ty* in *Esna* II, 17, 54; 113, 8.

Awake, Chief of the Potter's wheel![^fn-249-2b]  
Building humans, all livestock,  
serpents, fish, fowl;  
he who separates each limb,   
surrounds (them with) skin,[^fn-249-3]  
and distinguished tongues to speak.  

</div>

[^fn-249-2b]: Note that here the hymn switches from *rs=k nfr*, to simply *rs* + Noun.

[^fn-249-3]: ![](./images/249_2_17.png){width=12%} - @sauneron-langues, p. 37; @sauneron-5, p. 89, translated this group as "(celui qui) colore le(s) peau(x)", without further comment. @leitz-loeffler, pp. 16, 42, 51, transcribed it as *wtr*, "färben", an otherwise unattested verb, apparently related to *(w)tr*, "blood; red color." While this translation makes sense and belongs to a general theme, the main problem is the determinative. Instead, one might compare the compound preposition *(r)-rwty*, "outside of; surrounding", which often has this determinative. Rather than describing different skin colors, this epithet would refer to Khnum manually adding skin to his creatures. Compare [Esna 250], 9: "he who fashions skin upon the limbs (*nbỉ ỉnm ḥr ʿ.wt*)."
