^6^ Another hymn of Khnum-Re,  
Chief of ^7^ the potter's wheel,[^fn-250-1]  
he having populated the earth  
through his activity.

</div>

[^fn-250-1]: ![](./images/250_6.png){width=40%} - The beginning has been explained differently over the years, see @leitz-loeffler, p. 52, n. 188. The present translation follows the suggestion by @sauneron-3, p. 130, n. c, that the *ḥr*-sign should be read after the ideogram of Khnum the potter, forming his epithet *ḥry-nḥp*, "chief of the potter's wheel", which is much more common at Esna than simple *nḥp*, "the Potter."

He who assembles within the womb,   
who builds while keeping chicks healthy,    
having enlivened children  
with the breath of his mouth.  
  
He constructed[^fn-250-2] this planet,    
including Nun,  
as the *šn-wr* and *pẖr-wr* seas surrounded him.  
  
He modeled gods and humans,  
he fashioned all livestock,  
he made birds along with fi[sh],  
he constructed bulls,   
and he birthed cows.

</div>

[^fn-250-2]: Despite the reservations by @sauneron-5, p. 97, n. c, this is most likely the verb *sȝp/sỉpỉ*, "to erect a building," rather than "to flood."

- Again, despite the misleading wood determinative in this term, which led @sauneron-5, p. 98, n. i, to render this as *ʿfd.t*, "chest", this is more likely to be read *bd.t*, "womb", a term which occurs elsewhere in this hymn and at Esna: @sauneron-rde15, pp. 57-60; @meeks-delta, p. 113, n. 350. See the similar passage above in column 7: *qȝs ḫnty štȝ.t*. Different reading by @leitz-loeffler, pp. 38-39.

[^fn-250-3b]: Based on the syntax, the *tỉt*-sign most likely represents an adjective modifying *wtr*, "blood", rather than a second direct object, such as *tỉt*, "image; form". For other interpretations, see @leitz-loeffler, pp. 39-40.

</div>

[^fn-250-5]: For this group, scholars have proposed various terms meaning "teeth" or "rows of teeth." None of these are convincing, since *ʿm/sʿm* means "to swallow." Rather, this is probably a metaphorical use of *msn.t*, "foundation pit", here referring to the oral cavity.

The divine-heart leads,

The (female) 'front parts' (lit. flesh)    
absorb everything;    
the 'rear part' (lit. flesh)   
vents (lit. let breathe)   
the internal organs,  
both while dining,  
and while keeping embryos alive   
in the 'time of darkness' (i.e. pregnancy)[^fn-250-7].
  
</div>
  
[^fn-250-7]: The 'front parts' refer specifically to female genitalia. The second part of this section seems to reflect a belief that internal organs, including the embryo in the womb, needed to exhale through the rear.

</div>

[^fn-250-9]: @leitz-loeffler, pp. 34-36, dubbed this section one of the most difficult sections of the hymn. The present translation closely follows Sauneron, but other interpretations are certainly possible.

</div>

[^fn-250-10]: Following the translation by @mathieu-esna, p. 515, n. ll, who sees in this a conclusion to the entire creation account. @leitz-loeffler, p. 54, translated: "wobei sie (all Knochen) in der Ausdehnung (= unter der Kontrolle?) des Herzens sind," but it is unclear how the bones specifically might be controlled by the heart. Sauneron, and subsequent editions, split the text at the end of column 11, but then the subsequent phrase must be translated as a passive. Instead, the heart at the end of col. 11 belongs to the form of Khnum mentioned at the beginning of col. 12.

in order to nourish their bodies,  
along with (those) of their children.  

</div>

[^fn-250-11]: This is an unexpectedly specific allusion to a mining region in the Eastern desert of Lower Nubia. Perhaps it is evoked here because of the previous mention of "marvelous products (*bỉȝ.t*)." Alternatively, maybe the inhabitants were assumed to be hunter-gatherers, subsisting from the foods Tatenen created for them "upon their soil", rather than from agriculture.

[^fn-250-19]: ![](./images/250_17_2.png){width=15%} - @sauneron-5, p. 106, n. a, tentatively proposed understanding this group as "Metjenu", a form of Horus from Semenhor, but could not explain why. Instead, this phrase is most likely just a standard divine epithet, "lord of justification", with the winged scarab substituting for the similarly-shaped *nb*-basket.
