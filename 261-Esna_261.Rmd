</div>

[^fn-261-1]: The *zp-snw* indicates the initial *rs* hieroglyph is to be read  a second time here.

*nʿš dnỉw.t*  
*m ḥtp *  
*rs=k ḥtp.tw*

*bs n=f nṯr.w rmṯ.w*  
*ḥr ỉr(.t) wḏ.t=f*  
*m ḥtp *

who unites with females,  
for whom gods and people come forth  
doing whatever he commands,

</div>

#### §6 {-}

<div class="col2"> 

*rs bȝ wr-šfy.t*  
*qȝ-šw.ty spd-ḥn.ty*  
*m ḥtp *  
*rs=k ḥtp.tw*  
  
Awake, Ba great of prestige,

#### §7 {-}

<div class="col2"> 

*rs rw ʿȝ*  
*shd rqy.w*  
*m ḥtp *  
*rs=k ḥtp.tw*  
   
Awake, great lion,  
who punishes the rebels[^fn-261-2]  
in peace!  
May you awake, having rested!  

</div>

[^fn-261-2]: ![](./images/261_16_7.png){width=35%} - @sauneron-5, p. 365 translated "grand lion qui triomphe des rebelles"; *LGG* IV, 651a and 815b-c, registered the two epithets as: *rw ʿȝ* and *hd rqy.w*. Neither appear to have explained the presence of the crocodile. The simplest explanation is to understand it as representing the uniliteral *s*, thus writing the similar epithet shd rqy.w (*LGG* VI, 446b-c).
