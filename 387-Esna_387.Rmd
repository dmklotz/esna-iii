^1^ Another hymn to Khnum.  
Words spoken:   
  
Greetings to you,    
Khnum-Re Lord of Esna,   
that is: Ptah-Tatenen;    
Nun the great, father of the gods!   
  
That is: he who appears as the sundisk,    
and sails across the sky,    
without tiring;  
who goes around the Duat,    
who illumines the two lands,    
and drives away darkness,   
after he has shown himself.  
  
He invented the day,  
^2^ and he made the night;  
his heart is firm   
while rising and setting:    
the great sundisk,   
who shines in the Akhet.

Shining one, whom all live from seeing,  
every eye perceives through him;
he who established all eternall routines,  
who builds humans,  
who birthed the gods,    
who begat the Ennead,    
who begat everything.  
    
He who modelled ^3^ the gods on the wheel,   
after birthing the First Primeval one,    
who created all that exists.  
The first one, who made this [...] his heart,   
he conceived all plans through his mind.  
  
Mysterious of births,  
numerous of manifestations,  
one cannot know his sacred image.

Sole god   
who made himself into millions,[^fn-387-1] 
who made all that exists  
^4^ through his activity.  
  
Primeval one, who began existence,  
who bound the nomes through his plans;   
who puts everybody on the proper paths,   
going up and downstream   
beholding his two divine eyes (sun and moon).

[^fn-387-1]: Here and below (col. 5), the Heh god is followed by a *nb*-basket, which @sauneron-5, p. 221, n. e, rendered as *ḥḥ-nb*. Yet both spellings are most likely decomposed versions of the conventional Heh emblem, who usually kneels on a similar basket.

He who emerged from Nun.  
The north-wind blows south  
through the command of this august god,  
and Hapi arrives according to his mind,     
having filled the two lands  
with his beauty.  
  
Living god, who enlivens ^5^ all things;  
water and air are held in his grasp,   
he gives thereof to whomever he pleases,  
all bodies are prostrate before him.  
  
He who gives a son and daughter  
to whomever beseeches him;  
the breath of life (for) humans,  
he guids it to every nose.

He who is remote from eyes,

^6^ one cannot know his true appearance.  
  
Sovereign of all eternity,  
his kingship endures every day;  
lord of counsel,  
effective of designs,  
he began work with his hands,  
distinguishing speech and making sounds.

He who makes the earth birth its contents,  
who binds together an heir,  
who produces the two lands,   
and created what is above and below.  
  
Beneficent god,  
he established ^7^ all that;  
he who makes all that,  
his commanded has never been overrun.[^fn-387-2]  
  
All this in its entirety:  
it is he who made it all,  
no work is even conceived   
without him knowing.  
  
May your beautiful face be kind   
to (Pharaoh, Living Eternally)|!

[^fn-387-2]: ![](./images/387_7_1.png){width=4.5%}![](./images/387_7_2.png){width=18%} - @sauneron-5, p. 222, n. k, thought the bird wrote *ḫn*. But overlooked parallels indicate it represents the auxiliary verb *pȝỉ*, "to accomplish in the past": see *Urk*. VIII, 142 (3); *Esna* II, 17, 41 (partially damaged).
