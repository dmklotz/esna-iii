^1^ The ritual of  
the Festival of Carrying the Staff    
performed in Per-Khnum Lord of the Field,  
on III Shomu 20 (= [Epiphi 20](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-ii-77.html#epiphi-20) ),  
in his good festival,  
the Festival of Carrying the Staff,  
or the Victory Festival of Khnum,    
as it is also called.  
It is celebrated from II Shomu 9 (= [Payni 9](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-ii-77.html#payni-9) )  
until IV Shomu 30 (= [Mesore 30](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-ii-77.html#mesore-30) ).

Regarding Per-Khnum of the Field (*sḫ.t*),  
it is the land of Hapi,   
it arose (*sḫỉ*) from the *sḫt*-flood:[^fn-196-0]  
(first) the top part stretched out,[^fn-196-0b]   
the Nun waters were driven out,    
and the sand was molded into the *ȝḫ.t*-field,[^fn-196-1]  
resulting in the initial mound   
which appeared from Nun in the beginning,   
before heaven, earth, or Duat existed:  
the breath (of) life, pillar of air, and light  
they emerged by themselves from among them.  

</div>

[^fn-196-0]: ![](./images/196_0.png){width=22%} - These are clearly puns on the epithet "Khnum Lord of the Field". @sauneron-5, pp. 317-318, n. c, transcribed somewhat differently: *sḫ.t qȝ s(y) m šḫ.t*, "le marais qui s'est exhaussé au-dessus de l'étendue d'eau-Sékhet." While this is possible, I prefer to see the first group as an unconventional spelling of the verb *sḫỉ*, "to rise". 

[^fn-196-0b]: ![](./images/196_0b.png){width=6%} - @sauneron-5, p. 318, n. d, did not translate these signs, but noted the first two could write *bnr* or *rwt*, "outside." Meanwhile, @lost-temples, p. 3, suggested " the summit (beginning of the high floodwaters) rushing (?) (*ḥwỉ pȝ tp (?)*). The first two signs regularly serve as classifiers for *pḏ*, "to stretch out; expand," and at least once serve alone to write this verb: [Esna 350], 16.

[^fn-196-1]: ![](./images/196_1.png){width=30%} - The first verb is apparently unique, and @sauneron-5, pp. 317-318, with n. g, tentatively read: "le sable fut mêlé à la terre cultivable," and subsequent translators have followed this. Nonetheless, since this refers to sand and water being formed into something solid, the primeval mound, this verb *btbt* or *bdbd* might derive from the same root as *bd*, "mold", the object used to fashion Sokar-Osiris figures out of sand and other materials during the Khoiak festivals:  *Wb* I, 483, 9-12.

II Shomu 9 (= [Payni 9](https://bookdown.org/shemanefer/Esna2/calendar-ii-77.html#payni-9) ),    
Re came to the place  
where is father Tatenen was,  
along with his son Shu,  
after the earth was in great chaos:  
fighting was going around all lands.   
  
His majesty was brought to the Upper Zone,    
west of Per-netjer,  
in order to conceal him  
from these rebels.  
   
He hid his conditions  
^4^ in the mysterious place,  
and he concealed himself  
within a mountain:  
The very great, Hidden Temple,  
its contents are unknown.[^fn-196-3]  
  
</div>

[^fn-196-3]: This hidden chapel of North Esna is also described in *Esna* II, 127, 9-10; 129, 2-3.

Then his son Shu came  
to see him,   
his heart was glad  
after he saw him,  
and his heart rested   
in his palace.  
Then he said to his father:  
'Praise to you,  
father of fathers,   
complete (*tm*) of limbs!'  
  
Thus he is called Atum (*Ỉtm*),  
the Guardian (wrS) of Day 9  
he is also called,  
because his Majesty stayed on guard (*wrš*)  
in this place.[^fn-196-4]  

</div>

[^fn-196-4]: Similar etymology of this god's name in *Esna* II, 129, 2. The same form of Atum appears again in *Esna* VI, 508, and possibly in *Esna* II, 163, 27.

Now afterwards,    
as for the rebels  
they heard him (Shu).  
  
^5^ Re said in the Upper Zone,   
to the west of Per-Khnum:  
'May you arise!  
They are coming to this mound,  
so they might create chaos  
among my followers.'  
  
So Shu and the Crew of Re  
they slaughtered the rebels of Re  
in this place.

He enters in across     
from the Upper Place, daily,     
so his father, Tatenen, might unite (*ẖnm*)    
with his son, Shu     
in his field (*sḫ.t*),

Everybody, please keep away

(Khnum), wide of steps against his enemies,   
great of power in Upper and Lower Egypt:  
it is he who makes bulls mate with cows;  
humans and all livestock  
they live from the food  
of the Lord of the Field.  
He is the Lord of Life,

He is the Lord of Food,  
who pours out(?) provisions.  
  
His heart is pleased  
with whomever treads upon his water;  
^7^ but his heart takes power  
against whomever violates his ground.  
He is the avenger,  
who makes the avenging demons,  
who announces what will come to pass,    
whatever he says happens immediately:  
nobody can act with him unaware.
