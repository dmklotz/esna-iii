#### Formula {-}

^1^ Offering the potter's wheel  
to the Potter:  
the (god) excellent of fingers  
in a great image.   
  
I [have come] before you,  
^2^ my father, Khnum-Re:  
I am one made by your hands.[^fn-254-0]  
  
I bring to you this potter's wheel,  
which your heart loves:  
it is your work  
which [populates] all lands.  

</div>

[^fn-254-0]: @leitz-loeffler, pp. 89, 92, n. e, emended the pronouns in this passage, but it makes perfect sense as is. Compare the similar scene *Esna* II, 15, 2-3, where the king brings the wheel to Khnum, telling him "you built me upon it." In both texts, the king emphasizes that Khnum personally created him.

He was distinguished  
in the Temple of the Father,  
among all those who came forth   
upon his potter's wheel,  
to serve as King  
in the four corners of the sky,

[^fn-254-1]: Restoration based on *Esna* II, 15, 13; [Esna 395], 7;  *Esna* VI, 537, 18. @leitz-loeffler, p. 92, n. i, restored *pr-[nṯr]*, "Per-[netjer]", but that toponym usually has a city determinative.

in his name of Khnum.

</div>

[^fn-254-2]: For this unusual epithet, see the discussion of @leitz-loeffler, pp. 93-94, n. r. As noted there, this passage seems to allude to Khnum-Re creating the 7 Khnums, even though those gods are not usually associated with specific cities.

[^fn-254-4]: ![](./images/254_16.png){width=8%} - @sauneron-3, p. 144, n. a, only left this handcopy in a footnote, noting the sign-order is very confused. Similarly, @leitz-loeffler, p. 95, n. bb, noted the poor condition of the signs, and refrained from offering any suggestions. Nonetheless, it is quite simple to recognize the ram-head with a solar disk, followed by the x-sign, as "the great Khnums" (*Esna* II, 16, 1; 58, 3; *Esna* VI, 474; [Esna 395], 12). The number seven, meanwhile, is composed of 5 (star) + 2.
