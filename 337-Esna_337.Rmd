^A^ The King of Upper and Lower Egypt,  
the Great mysterious one,  
who nurtures wheat;  
plentiful of grain,  
who creates all wheat, barley, seeds,[^fn-337-0]  
without their limit.  
  
Good Renenutet,  
lady of grain,[^fn-337-1]  
lady of food and provisions.  
Menhyt, lady of what exists.  

</div>  
[^fn-337-0]: Note that priests carry all these grains to the festival of Khoiak 1, as described on the same column: [Esna 346], 16; cf. @sauneron-5, p. 55.
[^fn-337-1]: ![](./images/337_A2.png){width=12%} - Similar spellings of *npry*, "grain" (Coptic: ⲛⲁⲫⲣⲓ) occur in *Esna* II, 155, 4; 176, 6; [Esna 351], A; cf. @vernus-form.

^B^ The King of Upper and Lower Egypt,  
Khnum the victorious(?)[^fn-337-2]  
mighty of scimitar,  
Lord of the Field.  
  
He who comes forth in justification,  
in his good festival  
of rendering decisions.  
  
The gods of nomes and cities -   
their hearts are pleased,  
having come to see him  
in justification;  
they repeat (this visit)  
in his great *wpy*-festival.[^fn-337-4]  
   
How lovely is his face on the first day,  
may you seize the second day![^fn-337-5]  
Khnum,  
combat is his delight.[^fn-337-6]
 
</div>


[^fn-337-2]: ![](./images/337_B1.png){width=16%} - The reading is not entirely certain, since this epithet appears to be without parallel. But similar spellings of *qn*, "power; might", occur on the same column in [Esna 350], 1 and 6. Compare also the epithet "Khnum Lord of power and might (*nb qn nḫt*)": [Esna 375], A. 
[^fn-337-4]: All of these phrases occur in the description of the "great *wpy*-festival" of [Khoiak 1](file:///C:/Users/klotzd/Esna/_book/calendar-i-55.html#khoiak-1): [Esna 346], 22; with allusions to this festival in *Esna* II, 81, 5-6; 127, 8.
[^fn-337-5]: Similar phrases occur in [Esna 346], 25; [Esna 351], A. Apparently days 1 and 2 refers to events on Khoiak 1 and 2: Khnum receives justification on the first, and visits his father Re on the second: [Esna 348]; cf. @sauneron-5, pp. 65-66.
[^fn-337-6]: The reading of these final signs is confirmed by [Esna 350], 16. Khnum Lord of the Field receives weapons from the king, and his epithets include: "battle is his delight (*ršw=f pw r'-(ʿ)-ḫt*)."
