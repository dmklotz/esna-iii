NB: The conclusion to the hymn [Esna 368], 36, apparently points to this hymn, since both text mention the phrase *ḏsr kȝ=f* in the title.

As you built ^31^ humans,  
so you made the gods,  
you modelled small and big livestock,  
and you fashioned snakes, serpents,  
fish and fowl:  
thus do you [create] all things

You distinguished the king,   
as a lord among them all,   
issuing commands to them.   
You magnified his prestige,    
as they act through his decree.

she acts as uraeus (*mḥn.t*) upon his head,  
in this her name of Menhyt (*Mnḥy.t*).  
  
The divine mother of Re:  
she nursed his Majesty,  
so she might magnify his strength   
against his enemies,  
^34^ in this her name of Neith.

Your image is with him,

[^fn-358-1]: ![](./images/358_37.png){width=12%} - There is a graphic pun involving the heart hieroglyph in this spelling of Thoth, and his standard epithet "Heart of Re" mentioned above.
[^fn-358-2]: ![](./images/358_38.png){width=11%} - Shu's name is spelled with the *ʿȝ*-sign for the similar *wȝḏ*-papyrus (a commmon substitution at Esna: @sauneron-2, p. xxxii).
