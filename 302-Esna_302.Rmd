^12^ Another hymn of Khnum.  
Words spoken:  
  
Greetings to you,  
august god who creates forms ^13^ daily,  
whose heart is excellent, and hands firm,  
since he loved to populate.  
Lord of the potter's wheel,  
who built people,  
and made gods, small livestock, cattle,  
birds, fish, and all snakes.  
  
Great pillar of air,  
who enters(?)[^fn-302-1] the flesh of the womb,  
who illumines the hidden region with his rays,  
who surrounds the egg (*swḥ.t*) with air (*swḥ*),  
who protects what he created   
in every belly.
   
</div>

[^fn-302-1]: The verb is written as *pr*, "to come forth", but that makes little sense in context. Rather, the snake was probably meant to face inwards, thus writing *ʿq*, "to enter."

The King of Upper and Lower Egypt,

Chief of the potter's wheel,  
Lord of the Ennead,  
Builder of Builders,

May your good face be kind

May you settle all places for him

[^fn-302-2]: Literally: "tight of throat", @leitz-loeffler, pp. 22, n. 91, 48; 101-102, n. t,  recognized this is a frequent designation of the fetus, since it does not yet breathe through the throat. This epithet thus refers to Khnum guiding the newborn through the birth canal. Compare the parallel in [Esna 320], 22.
[^fn-302-2b]: ![](./images/302_14_1.png){width=20%} - Note the spelling of Esna, which evokes themes of procreation, newborns, and the potter's wheel; cf. also [Esna 369], 38, and @leitz-loeffler, p. 93, n. l.
[^fn-302-3]: ![](./images/302_14_2.png){width=13%} - @leitz-loeffler, p. 55, recently transcribed the first epithet as *nḥp-nḥp.w*, "der die Töpfer töpfert". Yet an earlier example of this sequence clearly writes *qdỉ-qdỉ.w*, "builder of builders" (*Hibis* III, Pl. 32, 6-7). In *Esna* II, 183, 5, the same group occurs in an alliterative stanza featuring *q* (*sqȝ.n=f qȝy n qdỉ-qdỉ.w*), which further supports the present reading.
