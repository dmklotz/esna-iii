^1^ Offering the potter's wheel.[^fn-311-1]  
Words spoken:  
  
I bring to you this wheel,  
which your heart loves,    
so [you] might popul[ate] all lands  
with ^2^ its work:[^fn-311-2]   
enduring, effective, and firm.    
You fashion me upon it[^fn-311-3]    
to be heir of the two lands.  
There is no [work] performed    
without your knowing.  

</div>
  
[^fn-311-1]: ![](./images/311_1_1.png){width=13%} - @leitz-loeffler, pp. 99-100, n. a, suggested reading the double plumes as *p < psš-kf*, the similarly shaped implement from the Opening of the Mouth ritual. Alternatively, it might represent the biliteral value *ḥp*, derived from the *ḥpty*-crown, a special object that also features double plumes and ram horns.
  
[^fn-311-2]: ![](./images/311_2_1.png){width=5%} - This unique spelling of *kȝ.t*, "work" (clear from the context and parallel offering scenes), is derived from *kȝr*, "shrine", and the horizontal *tȝ*-sign ("earth"). 
  
[^fn-311-3]: ![](./images/311_2_2.png){width=13%} - @leitz-loeffler, pp. 97-98, alternatively translated "die Gott und Göttin fest werden lässt auf ihr. Oh, Erbe der beiden Länder! (*rwḏ nṯrw nṯrwt ḥr.f, jȝ jwʿ tȝwy*)." However, the king seems more likely to inherit the two lands, so a different translation is proposed here. The crocodile writes the verb *nbỉ*, "to fashion", in the related offering scene [Esna 395], 1, and the same sign stands for *nb*, "all; lord" elsewhere at Esna. Furthermore, the spelling of the first-person dependent pronoun is standard: @kurth-2, p. 600.

^7^ Words spoken by Khnum-Re,    
chief of the potter's wheel,    
great god, Lord of Esna.  
Artisan of life for the living,   
^8^ great of marvels  
in all lands.  
Potter [...]  
who nurtures ^9^ the child  
on the birthbrick,  
who magnifies the Ka of whom he loves  
while [...]  
beside ^10^ the woman,    
since his handiwork is within her.  
  
^11^ I give to you[^fn-311-4]  
the lifetime of the Eternal (Re),  
as *bỉty*-king of heaven;[^fn-311-5]    
and the *nsw*-kingship of Shu,  
every day for all [eternity].  

</div>

[^fn-311-4]: ![](./images/311_11_1.png){width=8%}![](./images/311_11_2.png){width=3.5%} - @leitz-loeffler, p. 98, understood this as an additional epithet of Khnum: "der die Lebenzeit als *nḥḥ*-Ewigkeit des Re emporhebt (*ʿḫ ʿḥʿw n nḥḥ Rʿ*)." However, based on the position of this text, one expects a speech by Khnum to the king, detailing what he gives in return for the offering. Presumably the scarab writes *dỉ < tȝ*, "earth", and the suffix pronoun *=k* derives from *qȝ*, "to be high."  *Nḥḥ*, "eternal one", is a frequent epithet of Re: *Wb* II, 302, 10. 

[^fn-311-5]: ![](./images/311_11_3.png){width=15%} - Presumably Neith is an error for the masculine *bỉty*-king, while the ideogram of Isis writes *p.t*, "sky": @kurth-1, p. 165, n. 636 (with references). @leitz-loeffler, p. 101, n. n, assumed these were uniliteral values for the following word *nswy.t*, "kingship."
